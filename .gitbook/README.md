# 🌌 HSML User Guide

Welcome to the **HSML (Hyperspace Modeling Language) User Guide** – your entry point to modeling the **Spatial Web**.

This guide bridges the **IEEE P2874™ Standard for Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture, and Governance** with hands-on modeling practices. Whether you are building **digital twins**, orchestrating **autonomous agents**, or designing **collaborative activities**, HSML provides the **semantic foundation** you need.



## 🚀 Why HSML?

The Spatial Web envisions a world where **people, devices, and AI agents** interact seamlessly in digital–physical spaces. HSML makes this possible by defining a **shared semantic vocabulary** for:

* **Entities & Domains** → Agents, Things, Tools, Digital Twins
* **Activities & Channels** → Workflows, collaborations, coordination
* **Governance & Credentials** → Policies, contracts, trust enforcement
* **Hyperspaces** → Spatial, metric, graph, cellular, and vector structures

With HSML you can:
✅ Represent **autonomous agents** and their capabilities
✅ Model **digital twins** that mirror real-world assets
✅ Coordinate **multi-agent activities** through **channels**
✅ Enforce **credentials and policies** for secure interactions
✅ Navigate **spaces** (from city maps to cellular grids) with unified semantics

## 🌐 HSML in Context

HSML is **built on the Semantic Web stack**:

* RDF 1.1/1.2 & RDF-star → data representation + statement metadata
* OWL 2 → ontologies with precise semantics
* SHACL → validation of models and payloads
* JSON-LD → seamless integration with the Web
* SPARQL/HSQL → querying across hyperspaces

Why this matters:

* 🔍 **Semantic precision** → unambiguous meaning
* 🔗 **Interoperability** → standards-based data exchange
* 🧠 **Reasoning** → inference and validation
* ⚡ **Extensibility** → grow models across domains
* 🌍 **Web-ready** → integrates into existing infrastructures



## 🎯 Example Use Cases (from IEEE P2874)

* **Smart Cities & Urban Digital Twins**

  * Traffic management with **agent–activity coordination**
  * IoT-enabled infrastructure linked to **digital twins**

* **IoT & Edge Networks**

  * **Things** modeled with sensors and actuators
  * **Agents using Tools** (APIs, devices) for automation
  * **Channels** for secure, real-time data sharing

* **Manufacturing & Robotics**

  * Robotic **Activities** (assembly, logistics)
  * **Tools** and sensors orchestrated by agents
  * Predictive maintenance with **digital twins**

* **Healthcare**

  * Patient care modeled as **workflows (Activities)**
  * **Secure Channels** for clinician–patient communication
  * **Credentials** for trusted operations

* **Defense & Emergency Response**

  * Crisis management through **multi-agent coordination**
  * Real-time **Channels** for mission execution
  * Situational awareness powered by **digital twins**
