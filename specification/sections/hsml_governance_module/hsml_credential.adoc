[[gov-credential]]
=== Class: `gov:Credential`

The class `gov:Credential` realizes the CREDENTIAL concept in IEEE P2874 §6.6.3. It specializes the W3C VC Data Model to carry attestations that govern identity, authorization, compliance, and trust across Domains and Activities.

[[gov-credential-key-reqs]]
==== Key Requirements (Normative)

. A `gov:Credential` *shall* be processable as a W3C Verifiable Credential (VC); core VC fields (e.g., `issuer`, `credentialSubject`, `proof`) *shall* be supported.
. Verification *shall* be two‑stage:
  .. **Cryptographic** — verify `proof` per the VC spec; failure *shall* reject the credential.
  .. **Semantic (conditional)** — if a schema is discoverable (from policy via `gov:CredentialProfile` and/or from `gov:hasSchema` in the credential), the `credentialSubject` *shall* be validated accordingly; failure *shall* make it semantically invalid for the intended purpose.
. A credential **need not embed** a schema; policies typically provide schema/constraints via `gov:CredentialProfile`. If present, a schema pointer *shall* use `gov:hasSchema`.
. Implementations *should* support multiple schema languages (e.g., SHACL, JSON Schema) and select a validator based on the schema’s media type and/or RDF type.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `gov:Credential`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | An Entity representing a permission, attestation, or claim that can be verified or required in the Spatial Web.
| Subclass Of | `vc:VerifiableCredential`, `core:Entity`
| Usage Note | Schema pointers are optional because policy‑linked `gov:CredentialProfile` typically supplies schema/constraints.

| **Property** | `gov:conformsToProfile`
| **IRI** | `https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/governance#conformsToProfile`
| **JSON name** | `conformsToProfile`
| **Requirement Level** | Optional
| **Cardinality** | 0..*
| **Domain** | `gov:Credential`
| **Range** | `gov:CredentialProfile`
| **Definition** | Identifies a credential profile the credential claims to meet; used as a routing/validation hint.
| **Usage Note** | Policy evaluation is governed by the policy’s required `gov:CredentialProfile`(s), not by this self‑assertion.

[[gov-credential-validation]]
==== Credential Validation Process

. **Stage 1 — Cryptographic (MUST):** Verify `proof` per VC spec; reject on failure.
. **Stage 2 — Semantic (IF schema discoverable):** If policy requires a `gov:CredentialProfile` and/or the credential provides `gov:hasSchema`, fetch the schema and validate `credentialSubject` using a suitable engine for the media type or RDF type.

[[gov-credential-policy-engines]]
==== Requirements for Policy Engines

. Policies *should* specify credential type/class and constraints via `gov:CredentialProfile`; engines *shall* fetch and apply referenced schemas.
. Engines *shall* support `gov:hasSchema` (generic). `gov:hasClaimSchema` is processed only as a deprecated alias.
