=== Class: act:VariableBinding

The class `act:VariableBinding` provides the concrete link between an abstract `act:Variable` in a schema and a specific value in an `act:Activity` instance.

`act:VariableBinding` is the mechanism that makes schemas reusable. It connects the abstract parameter slots defined in the `act:ActivitySchema` to the real-world data and entities used in a particular execution, ensuring that every `act:Activity` is a complete and self-contained record.

**Key Requirements**

* **Variable Reference**: A `act:VariableBinding` **SHALL** reference exactly one `act:Variable` from the parent activity's schema via the `act:bindsVariable` property.
* **Value Assignment**: A `act:VariableBinding` **SHALL** provide exactly one concrete value (either a literal or an IRI) via the `act:hasValue` property.
* **Context**: A `act:VariableBinding` only exists as part of an `act:Activity`, linked via the `act:hasBinding` property.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for act:VariableBinding
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `act:VariableBinding`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A binding that connects a `Variable` to a concrete value (object or literal) in the context of an `Activity`.
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | This class is the bridge between the abstract schema and the concrete activity. An `act:Activity` will have one `act:VariableBinding` instance for each parameter it provides.
| Rationale | Separates the abstract parameter definition from its concrete value, enabling the "Parameter/Binding Pattern" for maximum schema reusability.

| **JSON name** | `bindsVariable`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..1
| **Domain** | `act:VariableBinding`
| **Range** | `act:Variable`
| **Definition** | Connects a `VariableBinding` to the `Variable` it parameterizes.
| **Usage Note** | This property points to the "slot" in the schema that this binding is filling.

[[act-variablebinding-property-hasValue]]
===== Property: hasValue
.Property Definition: act:hasValue
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `act:hasValue`
| **IRI** | `https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/activity#hasValue`
| **JSON name** | `hasValue`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..1
| **Domain** | `act:VariableBinding`
| **Range** | `owl:Thing`
| **Definition** | The concrete value (IRI for an entity or a Literal for data) assigned in a `VariableBinding`.
| **Usage Note** | This property provides the actual data for a specific activity execution. The value provided **should** be validated against the `core:hasCondition` of the bound `act:Variable`.
