[[act-variablebinding]]
=== Class: act:VariableBinding

The class `act:VariableBinding` provides the concrete link between an abstract `act:Variable` in a schema and a specific value in an `act:Activity` instance.

`act:VariableBinding` is the mechanism that makes schemas reusable. It connects the abstract parameter slots defined in the `act:ActivitySchema` to the real-world data and entities used in a particular execution, ensuring that every `act:Activity` is a complete and self-contained record.

**Key Requirements**

* **Variable Reference**: A `act:VariableBinding` **SHALL** reference exactly one `act:Variable` from the parent activity's schema via the `act:variable` property, using the variable's local identifier.
* **Value Assignment**: A `act:VariableBinding` **SHALL** provide exactly one concrete value (either a literal or a resource) via the standard `rdf:value` property.
* **Context**: A `act:VariableBinding` only exists as part of an `act:Activity`, linked via the `act:hasBinding` property.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for act:VariableBinding
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `act:VariableBinding`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A binding that connects a `Variable` to a concrete value (object or literal) in the context of an `Activity`.
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | This class is the bridge between the abstract schema and the concrete activity. An `act:Activity` will have one `act:VariableBinding` instance for each parameter it provides.
| Rationale | Separates the abstract parameter definition from its concrete value, enabling the "Parameter/Binding Pattern" for maximum schema reusability.

==== Properties

This section provides the detailed normative definitions for the properties of the `act:VariableBinding` class.

[[act-variablebinding-property-variable]]
===== Property: variable
.Property Definition: act:variable
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `act:variable`
| **IRI** | `https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/activity#variable`
| **JSON name** | `variable`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..1
| **Domain** | `act:VariableBinding`
| **Range** | `xsd:string`
| **Definition** | Connects a `VariableBinding` to the `Variable` it parameterizes by referencing the variable's identifier.
| **Usage Note** | The value of this property **SHALL** match the `schema:identifier` of an `act:Variable` defined in the activity's schema. This provides a consistent, portable binding mechanism.
|===

[[act-variablebinding-property-value]]
===== Property: value
.Property Definition: rdf:value
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `rdf:value`
| **IRI** | `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#value`
| **JSON name** | `value`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..1
| **Domain** | `act:VariableBinding`
| **Range** | `rdfs:Resource` or `rdfs:Literal`
| **Definition** | The concrete value assigned in a `VariableBinding`.
| **Usage Note** | This standard RDF property is used to provide the actual data for a specific activity execution. The value can be a literal (e.g., string, number, boolean) or a URI pointing to another entity. The value provided **should** be validated against the `core:hasCondition` of the bound `act:Variable`.
