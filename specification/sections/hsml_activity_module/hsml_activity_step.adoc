[[act-activitystep]]
=== Class: act:ActivityStep

The class `act:ActivityStep` realizes the **ACTIVITY STEP** concept as part of a `act:CompositeActivitySchema` in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3.

“An ACTIVITY STEP is an addressable node within a composite activity's workflow, representing a discrete stage of execution that uses a specific `act:ActivitySchema` to define its logic.”

`act:ActivityStep` is a structural component used to build complex workflows. It acts as a placeholder or node in a workflow graph, separating the structure of the workflow from the logic of the individual steps. This allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and governable multi-step processes.

**Key Requirements**

* **Context**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHALL** only exist as part of a `act:CompositeActivitySchema`, linked via properties like `act:hasStep`.
* **Logic Definition**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHALL** reference exactly one `act:ActivitySchema` via the `act:usesSchema` property to define its executable logic.
* **Identification**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHOULD** have a unique identifier within the scope of its parent composite schema to facilitate addressing by `act:DataLink` instances.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for act:ActivityStep
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `act:ActivityStep`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A unique, addressable step within a `act:CompositeActivitySchema`. Each step is an element of the workflow and points to an `act:ActivitySchema` that it executes.
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | An `act:ActivityStep` acts as a node in a workflow graph. It is a structural placeholder, not the logic itself.
| Rationale | Modeling steps as first-class entities makes the workflow structure explicit, addressable, and governable, allowing metadata to be attached to individual stages of a process.

| **Property** | `act:usesSchema`
| **IRI** | `https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/activity#usesSchema`
| **JSON name** | `usesSchema`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `act:ActivitySchema`
| **Definition** | Links an `act:ActivityStep` to the `act:ActivitySchema` that defines its executable logic.

[[act-activitystep-property-identifier]]
===== Property: identifier
.Property Definition: dct:identifier
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `dct:identifier`
| **IRI** | `http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier`
| **JSON name** | `identifier`
| **Requirement Level** | Recommended
| **Cardinality** | 0..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `xsd:string`
| **Definition** | A locally unique identifier for the step.
| **Usage Note** | **Should** be used to uniquely identify a step within a `act:CompositeActivitySchema` so that `act:DataLink` instances can reliably reference it as a source or target.
