[[act-activitystep]]
=== Class: act:ActivityStep

The class `act:ActivityStep` realizes the **ACTIVITY STEP** concept as part of a `act:CompositeActivitySchema` in <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.6.3">>.

[quote]
____
An ACTIVITY STEP is an addressable node within a composite activity's workflow, representing a discrete stage of execution that uses a specific `act:ActivitySchema` to define its logic.
____

`act:ActivityStep` is a structural component used to build complex workflows. It acts as a placeholder or node in a workflow graph, separating the structure of the workflow from the logic of the individual steps. This allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and governable multi-step processes with declarative control flow, including **conditional branching**.

**Key Requirements**

* **Context**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHALL** only exist as part of a `act:CompositeActivitySchema`, linked via properties like `act:hasStep`.
* **Logic Definition**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHALL** reference exactly one `act:ActivitySchema` via the `act:usesSchema` property to define its executable logic.
* **Identification**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHOULD** have a simple, locally-unique `schema:identifier` to simplify referencing within the workflow definition.
* **Description**: An `act:ActivityStep` **SHOULD** have a human-readable `schema:name` for display purposes and **MAY** have a `schema:description` for detailed documentation.
* **Conditional Execution**: An `act:ActivityStep` **MAY** include an `act:hasCondition` to enable conditional branching within a workflow.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for act:ActivityStep
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `act:ActivityStep`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A unique, addressable step within a `act:CompositeActivitySchema`. Each step is an element of the workflow that points to an `act:ActivitySchema` it executes and can be annotated with names, descriptions, and conditional logic.
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | An `act:ActivityStep` acts as a node in a workflow graph. It is a structural placeholder that defines a unit of work.
| Rationale | Modeling steps as first-class entities makes the workflow structure explicit, addressable, and governable, allowing metadata, documentation, and conditional logic to be attached to individual stages of a process.

==== Properties

This section provides the detailed normative definitions for the properties of the `act:ActivityStep` class.

[[act-activitystep-property-usesSchema]]
===== Property: usesSchema
.Property Definition: act:usesSchema
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `act:usesSchema`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/activity#usesSchema]
| **JSON name** | `usesSchema`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `act:ActivitySchema`
| **Definition** | Links an `act:ActivityStep` to the `act:ActivitySchema` that defines its executable logic.
| **Usage Note** | The referenced schema can be either atomic or another composite schema, allowing for nested workflows.
|===

[[act-activitystep-property-name]]
===== Property: name
.Property Definition: schema:name
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `schema:name`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://schema.org/name]
| **JSON name** | `name`
| **Requirement Level** | Recommended
| **Cardinality** | 0..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `xsd:string`
| **Definition** | A short, human-readable name for the activity step.
| **Usage Note** | This property is intended for display in user interfaces, such as workflow diagrams or logs. For example: "Validate User Credentials". Reuses the property from Schema.org.
|===

[[act-activitystep-property-description]]
===== Property: description
.Property Definition: schema:description
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `schema:description`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://schema.org/description]
| **JSON name** | `description`
| **Requirement Level** | Optional
| **Cardinality** | 0..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `xsd:string`
| **Definition** | A detailed explanation of the step's purpose, inputs, outputs, or behavior.
| **Usage Note** | This property is for documentation and maintainability, helping developers understand the role of the step in the overall process. Reuses the property from Schema.org.
|===

[[act-activitystep-property-hasCondition]]
===== Property: hasCondition
.Property Definition: act:hasCondition
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `act:hasCondition`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/activity#hasCondition]
| **JSON name** | `hasCondition`
| **Requirement Level** | Optional
| **Cardinality** | 0..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `core:Condition`
| **Definition** | An optional condition that must evaluate to true for this step to be eligible for execution.
| **Usage Note** | This property provides the mechanism for conditional control flow. When multiple steps are presented as part of an `act:hasChoice` construct, the runtime engine **SHALL** evaluate the `act:hasCondition` for each step. The first step whose condition evaluates to true **SHALL** be the path that is executed.
|===

[[act-activitystep-property-identifier]]
===== Property: identifier
.Property Definition: schema:identifier
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `schema:identifier`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://schema.org/identifier]
| **JSON name** | `identifier`
| **Requirement Level** | Recommended
| **Cardinality** | 0..1
| **Domain** | `act:ActivityStep`
| **Range** | `xsd:string`
| **Definition** | A locally unique, human-friendly identifier for the step.
| **Usage Note** | This identifier provides a simple, stable "nickname" (e.g., "stepA", "validateUser") that **SHOULD** be used to uniquely identify the step *within its parent `act:CompositeActivitySchema`*. This makes it easier for `act:DataLink` instances to reliably reference the step as a source or target without using long, complex URIs.
