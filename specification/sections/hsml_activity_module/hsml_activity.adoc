[[act-activity]]
=== Class: act:Activity

The class `act:Activity` realises the **ACTIVITY** concept defined in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“An ACTIVITY is an execution-time entity representing a single, concrete, stateful instance of an `act:ActivitySchema` performed by a specific agent at a specific time.”

`act:Activity` is the primary entity for recording and tracking the execution of an action in the Spatial Web. It serves as a stateful, auditable record that links the abstract `act:ActivitySchema` to the concrete agents and values involved in a specific occurrence.

**Key Requirements**

* **Identity**: Every `act:Activity` **SHALL** possess a Spatial Web Identifier (`hsml:swid`, W3C DID Core-compliant).
* **Schema Conformance**: An `act:Activity` **SHALL** reference exactly one `act:ActivitySchema` via the `act:activitySchema` property.
* **Agent Assignment**: An `act:Activity` **SHALL** identify the `hsml:Agent`(s) responsible for its execution via the `act:performedBy` property.
* **Parameter Binding**: An `act:Activity` **SHALL** provide concrete values for all required inputs of its schema using `act:VariableBinding` instances.
* **Lifecycle Tracking**: An `act:Activity` **SHALL** have its current state tracked via the `act:status` property, using the normative HSML Activity Status vocabulary.
* **Temporality**: An `act:Activity` **SHOULD** record the time execution began (`schema:startTime`) and concluded (`schema:endTime`).
* **Execution Traceability**: If an `act:Activity` is part of a composite workflow, it **SHOULD** link to its parent activity (`dct:isPartOf`) and the step it realized (`act:realizedStep`).

These requirements ensure that every executed action is a complete, self-contained, and verifiable record that is traceable to its defining schema and responsible agent.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for act:Activity
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `act:Activity`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A concrete, stateful execution of an `act:ActivitySchema`. It is the record of an action that has been, is being, or is planned to be performed.
| Subclass Of | `hsml:Entity`
| Usage Note | An `act:Activity` instance is created for every action that is initiated via a `gov:Contract`. It contains `act:VariableBinding` instances for all required inputs and its `act:status` property tracks its lifecycle.
| Rationale | Provides the normative record of execution for all actions, ensuring that every event is auditable, governable, and traceable to its formal definition and responsible parties.
