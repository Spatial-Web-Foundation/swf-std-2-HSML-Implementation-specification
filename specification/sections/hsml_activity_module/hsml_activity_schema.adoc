[[act-activityschema]]
=== Class: `act:ActivitySchema`

The class `act:ActivitySchema` realises the ACTIVITY SCHEMA concept defined in <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.6.3">>:

[quote]
____
An ACTIVITY SCHEMA is an ENTITY that defines the template, structure, or plan for an ACTIVITY, specifying its preconditions, postconditions, roles, and expected outcomes.
____

`act:ActivitySchema` provides the abstract, reusable blueprint for an `act:Activity`. It enables the consistent modeling of repeatable processes by defining the action's interface (inputs/outputs), its required logical state (preconditions), and its expected results (effects).

Key Requirements

* Identity: Every `act:ActivitySchema` SHALL possess a Spatial Web Identifier (hsml:swid, W3C DID Core-compliant).

* Condition Specification: An `act:ActivitySchema` SHOULD define its required state and results using act:hasPrecondition and act:hasEffect.

* Parameterization: An `act:ActivitySchema` SHALL declare its interface of expected parameters using act:hasInput and act:hasOutput, which reference act:Variable instances.

These requirements ensure that activities based on schemas are machine-checkable, consistent, and reusable in Spatial Web systems.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for `act:ActivitySchema`
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `act:ActivitySchema`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A reusable, design-time template for a type of activity, defining its logic, interface (inputs and outputs), preconditions, and effects.
| Subclass Of | `hsml:Entity`
| Usage Note | Schemas are published and reused across multiple act:Activity instances. They are the foundation of the "trust-by-reference" governance model.
| Rationale | Provides a formal mechanism for modeling reusable processes and workflows in compliance with the P2874 Activity model, separating the definition of an action from its execution.
