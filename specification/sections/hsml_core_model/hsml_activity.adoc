[[hsml-activity]]
=== Class: hsml:Activity

The class hsml:Activity realises the ACTIVITY concept defined in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“An ACTIVITY is a temporally extended process, event, or action represented as an ENTITY that an AGENT can effect in pursuit of a GOAL.”

hsml:Activity models dynamic processes that cause or track state changes within the Spatial Web. It captures both abstract descriptions (schemas) and concrete instances (executions), supporting lifecycle monitoring, participation, and coordination.
