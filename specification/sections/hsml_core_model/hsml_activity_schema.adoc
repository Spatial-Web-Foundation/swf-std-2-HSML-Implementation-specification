[[hsml-activityschema]]
=== Class: hsml:ActivitySchema

The class hsml:ActivitySchema realises the ACTIVITY SCHEMA concept defined in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“An ACTIVITY SCHEMA is an ENTITY that defines the template, structure, or plan for an ACTIVITY, specifying its preconditions, postconditions, roles, and expected outcomes.”

hsml:ActivitySchema provides the abstract definition or blueprint for Activities. It enables consistent modeling of repeatable or templated processes, supports validation of Activity instances, and guides execution semantics within the Spatial Web.

Key Requirements

* Identity: Every ActivitySchema SHALL possess a Spatial Web Identifier (hsml:swid, W3C DID Core-compliant).
* Condition Specification: An ActivitySchema SHALL define preconditions and postconditions (hsml:preCondition, hsml:postCondition).
* Parameterization: An ActivitySchema SHALL declare expected input/output variables (hsml:hasInput, hsml:hasOutput).
* Instance Linkage: Activity instances MAY link back to their schema via hsml:activitySchema.

These requirements ensure that Activities based on schemas are machine-checkable, consistent, and repeatable in Spatial Web systems.
