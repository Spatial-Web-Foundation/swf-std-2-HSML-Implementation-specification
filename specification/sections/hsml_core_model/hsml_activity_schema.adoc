[[hsml-activityschema]]
=== Class: hsml:ActivitySchema

The class hsml:ActivitySchema realises the ACTIVITY SCHEMA concept defined in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“An ACTIVITY SCHEMA is an ENTITY that defines the template, structure, or plan for an ACTIVITY, specifying its preconditions, postconditions, roles, and expected outcomes.”

hsml:ActivitySchema provides the abstract definition or blueprint for Activities. It enables consistent modeling of repeatable or templated processes, supports validation of Activity instances, and guides execution semantics within the Spatial Web.

Key Requirements

Identity Every ActivitySchema SHALL possess a Spatial Web Identifier (hsml:swid, W3C DID Core-compliant).

Role Definition An ActivitySchema SHALL specify at least one required role or actor type (hsml:requiresRole).

Condition Specification An ActivitySchema SHALL define preconditions and postconditions (hsml:preCondition, hsml:postCondition).

Instance Linkage Activity instances MAY link back to their schema via hsml:hasSchema.

Extensibility ActivitySchemas MAY declare required credentials, tools, or parameter structures.

These requirements ensure that Activities based on schemas are machine-checkable, consistent, and repeatable in Spatial Web systems.
