[[hsml-variable]]
=== Class: hsml:Variable

The class hsml:Variable realizes the VARIABLE concept as part of an ACTIVITY SCHEMA in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3.

“A VARIABLE represents a typed parameter or binding placeholder within an ACTIVITY SCHEMA, used to specify required inputs, produced outputs, or contextual bindings.”

hsml:Variable supports the **declaration → binding → validation** pipeline for activities, enabling ActivitySchemas to define reusable templates with explicit parameter slots.

==== Key Requirements

* **Declaration** — Variables SHALL be declared in an `hsml:ActivitySchema` as inputs or outputs.
* **Binding** — Each bound value in an `hsml:Activity` SHALL be expressed using `hsml:VariableBinding` linked to its schema Variable.
* **Validation** — All bound values SHALL be validated against `hsml:Constraints`. 

This ensures ActivitySchemas are executable blueprints with clearly defined inputs, outputs, and governance rules.

| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A parameter definition in an ActivitySchema, representing an input, output, or contextual binding.
| Subclass Of | hsml:Entity
| Usage Note | Variables define the schema for Activity parameters, enabling validation of required/optional bindings.
| Rationale | Provides a formal structure for parameterizing Activities, ensuring correctness, reusability and repeatability in accordance with P2874’s Activity model.
