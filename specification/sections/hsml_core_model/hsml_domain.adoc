[[hsml-domain]]
=== Class: hsml:Domain

The class hsml:Domain realises the DOMAIN concept defined in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“A DOMAIN is a context-defining ENTITY in which other ENTITIES are located, organized, or governed. A Domain may represent a physical, logical, organizational, or virtual space in the Spatial Web.”

hsml:Domain provides the foundational container for structuring the Spatial Web. It defines the scope within which Entities exist, relationships apply, and governance operates. Domains can nest, forming hierarchies or networks of contexts.

These requirements ensure that Domains provide structure, identity, and governance scope within the Spatial Web.
