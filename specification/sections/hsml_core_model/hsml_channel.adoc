[[hsml-channel]]
=== Class: hsml:Channel

The class `hsml:Channel` realises the CHANNEL concept in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.6:

“A CHANNEL is a stream of HSML ENTITIES that are related to an ACTIVITY of a specific context that does not itself warrant a DOMAIN or hierarchy.”

`hsml:Channel` provides a contextual container that links participants, data, and messages around specific Activities or purposes without forming part of the permanent domain hierarchy. It enables ad-hoc, session-based, or otherwise transient coordination and monitoring.
