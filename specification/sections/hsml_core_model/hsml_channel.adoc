[[hsml-channel]]
=== Class: hsml:Channel

The class hsml:Channel realises the CHANNEL concept in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“A CHANNEL is a stream of HSML ENTITIES that are related to an ACTIVITY of a specific context that does not itself warrant a DOMAIN or hierarchy.”

hsml:Channel provides a contextual container that links participants, data, and messages around specific Activities or purposes without forming part of the permanent domain hierarchy. It enables ad hoc, ephemeral, or session-based communication, coordination, or monitoring.
