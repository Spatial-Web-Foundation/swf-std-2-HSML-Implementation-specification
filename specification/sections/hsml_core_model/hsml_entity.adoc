[[core-entity]]
=== Class: core:Entity

The class `core:Entity` corresponds to the base concept **ENTITY** in IEEE P2874 Section 6.6.2, defined as “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist”. As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `core:Entity` provides the universal foundation upon which all other HSML classes are built.

**Key Requirements**

- **Identity**: Every `core:Entity` **SHALL** include a Spatial Web Identifier (`core:swid`) conformant with W3C DID Core.
- **Extensibility**: An entity **MAY** declare one or more subclasses to specialize its semantics.
- **Credentials**: An entity **MAY** link to zero or more `w3c:VerifiableCredential` instances.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `core:Entity`
| Is Abstract | Yes
| Definition | An _ENTITY_ is “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist.”
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | `core:Entity` is an abstract class and should not be instantiated directly. Only its subclasses should be instantiated. Instances **SHALL** include `core:swid`.
| Rationale | As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `core:Entity` provides a uniform, extensible foundation for all HSML constructs, enabling polymorphic processing and semantic interoperability.
