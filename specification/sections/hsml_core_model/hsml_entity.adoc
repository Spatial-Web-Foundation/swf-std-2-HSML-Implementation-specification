[[hsml-entity]]
=== Class: hsml:Entity

The class `hsml:Entity` corresponds to the base concept **ENTITY** in IEEE P2874 Section 6.6.2, defined as “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist”. As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `hsml:Entity` provides the universal foundation upon which all other HSML classes (Activities, Agents, Domains, Channels, Credentials, Hyperspaces, and Time) are built.

**Key Requirements**

- **Identity**: Every `hsml:Entity` **SHALL** include a Spatial Web Identifier (`hsml:swid`) conformant with W3C DID Core, enabling decentralized resolution and trust.  
- **Extensibility**: An entity **MAY** declare one or more subclasses to specialize its semantics for domain- or application-specific modeling.  
- **Credentials**: An entity **MAY** link to zero or more #hsml:Credential# instances, supporting verifiable claims and access control.

These requirements ensure that all HSML elements share a consistent identity mechanism, can be extended without altering the core specification, and support governed interactions via credentials. By acting as a polymorphic base class, `hsml:Entity` enables HSML-compliant software to uniformly ingest, validate, and manipulate heterogeneous spatial-web constructs, providing the semantic interoperability and governance features mandated by IEEE P2874.

| RDF Class
| +hsml:Entity+
| Is Abstract
| Yes

| Definition
| An _ENTITY_ is “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist.” 

| Subclass Of
| owl:Thing

| Usage Note
| Instances **SHALL** include `hsml:swid` as defined in P2874 §6.6.2; **MAY** include `rdfs:label` for human-readable naming.
`hsml:Entity` is an abstract class and should not be instantiated directly. Only its subclasses should be instantiated.

| Rationale
| As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, hsml:Entity provides a uniform, extensible foundation for all HSML constructs, enabling polymorphic processing and semantic interoperability across heterogeneous systems in compliance with IEEE P2874 Section 6.6.1.
