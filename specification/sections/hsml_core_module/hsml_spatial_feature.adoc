=== Class: hsml:SpatialFeature

The class hsml:SpatialFeature realises the SPATIAL FEATURE concept, corresponding to the GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN type described in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“A SPATIAL FEATURE is an ENTITY representing a location-bound or geometry-bearing element within a Domain, corresponding to a GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN type where position, extent, or spatial relationships are essential.”

hsml:SpatialFeature represents real or abstract entities anchored in space — such as landmarks, boundaries, sensor sites, or natural features — that are meaningful in spatial reasoning and analysis in the Spatial Web. It binds semantic entities to geospatial structure.

| RDF Class | +hsml:SpatialFeature+
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | An entity that represents a location-bound or geometry-bearing element of the GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN type in the Spatial Web.
| Subclass Of | hsml:Entity
| Usage Note | SpatialFeatures link semantic entities to geospatial structures (geometry, topology, metric) for reasoning, mapping, or analysis.
| Rationale | Provides a formal mechanism to model GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN instances (per P2874) and bind entities to spatial coordinates, shapes, and relationships.
