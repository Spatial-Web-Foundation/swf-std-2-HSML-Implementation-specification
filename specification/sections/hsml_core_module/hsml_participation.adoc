[[core-participation]]
=== Class: core:Participation

The class core:Participation is the generic link object that models an entity's involvement in a host resource (e.g., a gov:Contract, ev:Event, or act:Activity). It is a reified relationship that states:

* What entity is involved (via core:hasParticipant),
* What role it plays (via core:hasRole), and
* Optionally, the duration of the involvement (via schema:startTime and schema:endTime).

This pattern is fundamental in the Spatial Web because it provides a standardized, reusable mechanism for describing and querying participation across heterogeneous contexts. It prevents model duplication and ensures that agentic, legal, and procedural interactions are captured consistentlyâ€”critical for maintaining trust, accountability, and semantic precision.
