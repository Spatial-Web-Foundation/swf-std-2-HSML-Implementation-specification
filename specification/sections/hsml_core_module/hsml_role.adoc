[[core-role]]
=== Class: core:Role

The class `core:Role` represents a named capacity, position, or function that a bearer (e.g., person, agent, device, or service) may hold within some context. It is a **definition-level concept** (the role itself), distinct from any particular assignment or holding of that role.

**Key Requirements**

* **Typing**: Every instance **SHALL** declare its class via the `rdf:type` property.
* **Minimal Metadata**: Role definitions **SHOULD** provide a human-readable `schema:name` and **MAY** include a `schema:description`.
* **Neutral & Standalone**: `core:Role` **SHALL NOT** require any superclass from external ontologies and **SHALL** remain independent of assignment-specific data (e.g., time bounds, authority, or basis).

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `core:Role`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A named capacity, position, or function that can be held by an agent, object, or service within a context.
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | `core:Role` captures the *definition* of a role. Assignment-specific details (bearer, time, authority, basis) **SHOULD NOT** be modeled on this class and belong in a separate assignment pattern if needed.
| Rationale | Provides a lightweight, interoperable notion of “role” that can be reused across activities, memberships, stewardship, and other Spatial Web contexts without imposing external ontology dependencies.
