=== Class: core:Entity

The class `core:Entity` realizes the base concept **ENTITY** in IEEE P2874 Section 6.6.2, defined as “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist”.

As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `core:Entity` provides the universal, abstract foundation upon which all other HSML classes are built. It establishes the mandatory requirements for universal identification and class declaration, ensuring that every object in the ecosystem is uniquely addressable and explicitly typed.

**Key Requirements**

* **Identity**: Every `core:Entity` **SHALL** possess a Spatial Web Identifier (`core:swid`) conformant with W3C DID Core syntax.
* **Typing**: Every instance **SHALL** declare its specific, concrete class via the `rdf:type` property.
* **Extensibility**: The `core:Entity` model is designed to be subclassed to create more specialized types. It **SHALL NOT** be instantiated directly.

These requirements ensure that all HSML constructs share a common, machine-readable foundation, enabling polymorphic processing, universal identification, and semantic interoperability.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `core:Entity`
| Is Abstract | Yes
| Definition | An _ENTITY_ is “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist.”
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | `core:Entity` is an abstract class and **SHALL NOT** be instantiated directly. Only its concrete subclasses should be instantiated.
| Rationale | As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `core:Entity` provides a uniform, extensible foundation for all HSML constructs, enabling universal identification and semantic interoperability.

==== Properties

This section provides the detailed normative definitions for the properties of the `core:Entity` class.

[[core-entity-property-type]]
===== Property: type
.Property Definition: rdf:type
[cols="2,4"]
|===
|**Property** | `rdf:type`
|**IRI** | identifier:[http://www.w.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type]
|**JSON name** | `@type`
|**Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
|**Cardinality** | 1..*
|**Domain** | `core:Entity`
|**Range** | `rdfs:Class`
|**Definition** | Declares the specific class (or classes) of which this resource is an instance.
|**Usage Note** | Every entity **SHALL** have at least one `rdf:type` that specifies a concrete (non-abstract) subclass of `core:Entity`. Multiple types may be present, for example, to include inferred classes.
