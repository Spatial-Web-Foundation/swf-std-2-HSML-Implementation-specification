=== Class:  core:SHACLCondition

The class core:SHACLCondition is a concrete implementation of core:Condition that uses a SHACL shape for validation. It provides a standardized way to express constraints on the structure and values of RDF data.

As a foundational element of the Generic Condition Model, core:SHACLCondition is the primary mechanism for defining data types, cardinality, value ranges, and other structural rules for entities and variables throughout the HSML ontology.

.Key Requirements

Inheritance: Every core:SHACLCondition is a subclass of core:Condition.

Shape Definition: Every core:SHACLCondition SHALL link to exactly one sh:Shape via the core:hasShape property.

Validation Logic: The validation of a core:SHACLCondition is performed by evaluating the associated SHACL shape against a target RDF graph.
