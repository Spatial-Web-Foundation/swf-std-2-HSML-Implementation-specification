[[agt-goal]]
=== Class: agt:Goal

The class `agt:Goal` realizes the concept of an objective that an `agt:Agent` is motivated to achieve. A Goal represents a state or objective that an Agent seeks to bring about through its activities.

It can be instantiated directly to represent a general-purpose goal or serve as a parent class for more specialized goal types (e.g., `AchievementGoal`, `MaintenanceGoal`, TBD). Every `agt:Agent` is required to be linked to one `agt:Goal`, making this concept fundamental to defining goal-directed behavior in the Spatial Web.
