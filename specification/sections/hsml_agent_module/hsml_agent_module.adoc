== HSML Agent Module

=== Architectural Principles and Design Rationale

This clause describes the architectural principles underlying the HSML Agent Module. These principles are _informative_ and not required for conformance; however, understanding them is recommended to ensure robust and correct implementations.

==== The Goal-Directed Actor Pattern: Defining Purpose

A fundamental principle of the Agent Module is that all autonomous actions are **purpose-driven**. An agent doesn't simply act; it acts to achieve an objective. This is realized through a clear separation between the actor and its purpose:

* `agt:Agent` -- The actor itself. An autonomous entity capable of perception, decision-making, and action.
* `agt:Goal` -- A declarative, self-contained entity that represents the desired state or objective the agent seeks to achieve.

This separation is the cornerstone of **explainable AI** and **governable autonomy** in the Spatial Web. By making an agent's `Goal` an explicit, inspectable entity linked via the mandatory `agt:hasGoal` property, the model ensures that the "why" behind an agent's behavior is always a first-class citizen. This allows an orchestration engine or auditor to understand an agent's intent without needing to reverse-engineer its internal logic. It provides a clear, declarative basis for authorizing agent actions—if the goal is permissible within a domain, the agent's subsequent actions can be evaluated against it.

==== The Capability Model: Separating Potential from Action

Complementing the goal-directed pattern is the distinction between an agent's **potential to act** and its **actual performance of an action**. This is achieved by linking the agent to the `act:ActivitySchema` rather than to specific `act:Activity` instances:

* `agt:Agent` -- The actor.
* `act:ActivitySchema` -- A reusable template defining a _type_ of action an agent is capable of performing.
* `agt:canPerform` -- The property linking an `Agent` to the `act:ActivitySchema` instances that represent its skills or functions.

This design decouples the agent's intrinsic abilities from its operational history. The `agt:canPerform` property defines the agent's **skill set**, which is a relatively static and verifiable aspect of its identity. This allows a Domain Authority to grant credentials based on a clear, auditable list of an agent's capabilities. It ensures that governance is applied to what an agent _can do_ in principle, providing a stable foundation for trust and permissioning. The agent's actual execution of these capabilities is then recorded as separate `act:Activity` instances, creating a clean and auditable separation between an agent's potential and its performance.

==== The Specialization Pattern: Tailoring Agents and Goals

A key architectural principle is that the `agt:Agent` and `agt:Goal` classes are designed as extensible foundations. This allows the framework to support a wide variety of agent architectures—such as **Simple Reflex**, **Goal-based**, **Deliberative (BDI)**, or **LLM-based Agents**—without being overly prescriptive. The primary mechanism for this is the specialization of the base `agt:Goal` class, as the way an agent describes its goals is fundamental to its nature.

This enables the creation of specific `Goal` subclasses that align with different agent behaviors:

* `AchievementGoal`:: A goal to bring about a specific state of the world. Once the state is reached, the goal is considered achieved and is complete. For example, "Deliver a package to a specific address."
* `MaintenanceGoal`:: A goal to keep a specific condition continuously true over time. This type of goal persists and is never truly "complete." For example, "Keep the server uptime above 99.9%."
* `PerformingGoal`:: A goal where success is defined by the execution of an action itself, regardless of the resulting state. For example, "Perform a system diagnostic scan every 24 hours."
* `QueryGoal`:: A goal whose aim is to acquire information, to know the true value of a proposition, or to otherwise reduce uncertainty before planning or acting. For example, "Determine the current traffic conditions on the planned route."

By defining these and other goal specializations (like **Hard** vs. **Soft Goals** with preference models), the architecture allows for a rich and precise description of agent behavior. A sophisticated Deliberative Agent might pursue complex `AchievementGoal`s, while a simpler monitoring agent would be concerned with a `MaintenanceGoal`. This provides a flexible and future-proof framework that can adapt to new agent designs by simply introducing new, well-defined subclasses of `agt:Goal`.

==== The Embodiment Pattern: Separating Agency from Substrate


<<ieee-p2874,clause=" 6.3.2.1.7">> defines a `core:Thing` as a type of DOMAIN that:

[quote]
____
A thing type of DOMAIN shall encompass entities or objects that are bounded items without agency. These entities shall be passive and lack the ability for autonomous decision making or proactive behavior.
____

From this definition, HSML Core declares `agt:Agent` and `core:Thing` to be *disjoint classes*: an individual cannot simultaneously be a Thing and an Agent.

At the same time, many agents in the Spatial Web are *embodied*—for example, a human body, a humanoid robot, or a connected device that an agent inhabits. To support this without violating the disjointness constraint, the Agent Module introduces the *embodiment relation*:

* `agt:embodiedIn` -- links an `agt:Agent` to the `core:Thing` that serves as its embodiment.
* `agt:embodiedBy` -- the inverse, linking a `core:Thing` to the `agt:Agent` it embodies.

This pattern allows the ontology to represent:

* *Embodied agents* (e.g., humans, robots) as agents tied to a Thing that provides their physical or digital substrate.
* *Disembodied agents* (e.g., cloud services, software agents) as agents without any embodiment relation.

*Principle:* By separating agency (`agt:Agent`) from substrate (`core:Thing`) and linking them only through embodiment, HSML upholds the disjointness mandated by P2874 and avoids Cartesian dualism, while enabling a consistent way to model both embodied and disembodied agents.

=== Normative Classes

This clause provides the normative definitions for all class concepts within the HSML Agent Module. Each class is detailed in a table that specifies its URI, description, JSON-LD context name, usage notes, and relationship to other classes.

The namespace prefix `agt:` refers to identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/agent#].
