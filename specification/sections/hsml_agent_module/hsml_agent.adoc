[[agt-agent]]
=== Class: agt:Agent

The class `agt:Agent` realises the **AGENT** concept in <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.6.3">>:

[quote]
____
An ENTITY that senses, responds, and maintains a model of its environment while performing ACTIVITIES to achieve its goals.
____

`agt:Agent` represents an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and enacting `act:Activity` instances in pursuit of explicitly declared goals. An Agent may represent a person, robot, AI system, or other autonomous entity.

**Key Requirements**

* **Identity**:: Every `agt:Agent` **SHALL** possess a Spatial Web Identifier (`core:swid`, W3C DID Core–compliant).
* **Goal-Directed**:: An `agt:Agent` **SHALL** be linked to one or more objectives via `agt:hasGoal`.
* **Capability**:: An `agt:Agent` **SHALL** be linked to the `act:ActivitySchema` definitions it can perform via `agt:canPerform`.
* **Embodiment (when applicable)**:: If an Agent acts through a physical or digital substrate, it **SHOULD** indicate that substrate via `agt:embodiedIn` to a `core:Thing`. The inverse relation `agt:embodiedBy` links a `core:Thing` back to the Agent it embodies. Absence of `agt:embodiedIn` denotes a disembodied Agent.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for agt:Agent
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | `agt:Agent`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | An autonomous entity capable of perceiving, deciding, and performing Activities to achieve its goals.
| Subclass Of | `core:Domain`
| Disjoint With | `core:Thing`  // per P2874 Thing DOMAIN: bounded items **without agency**
| Usage Note | Agents are the actors in the Spatial Web. They declare goals, obtain authorization (e.g., via `gov:Contract`), and perform `act:Activity` instances.
| Rationale | Provides the normative model for autonomous actors in the Spatial Web, supporting goal-directed behavior, governed interactions, and (when relevant) explicit embodiment without conflating agency with substrate.

[[agt-agent-properties]]
==== Properties

This clause provides the detailed normative definitions for the properties of the `agt:Agent` class.

[[agt-agent-property-hasGoal]]
===== Property: hasGoal
.Property Definition: agt:hasGoal
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `agt:hasGoal`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/agent#hasGoal]
| **JSON name** | `hasGoal`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..*
| **Domain** | `agt:Agent`
| **Range** | `agt:Goal`
| **Definition** | Links an Agent to one or more goals that it aims to fulfill through its Activities.
| **Usage Note** | Goals are explicit, inspectable objects enabling explainable and governable autonomy; they may be specialized (e.g., Achievement, Maintenance) per the Agent’s design.
|===

[[agt-agent-property-canPerform]]
===== Property: canPerform
.Property Definition: agt:canPerform
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `agt:canPerform`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/agent#canPerform]
| **JSON name** | `canPerform`
| **Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
| **Cardinality** | 1..*
| **Domain** | `agt:Agent`
| **Range** | `act:ActivitySchema`
| **Definition** | Identifies the types of Activities the Agent is capable of performing.
| **Usage Note** | Declares an Agent’s skills as reusable templates (`act:ActivitySchema`). Actual executions are captured as `act:Activity` instances.
|===

[[agt-agent-property-embodiedIn]]
===== Property: embodiedIn
.Property Definition: agt:embodiedIn
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `agt:embodiedIn`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/agent#embodiedIn]
| **JSON name** | `embodiedIn`
| **Requirement Level** | **Recommended** (when embodied)
| **Cardinality** | 0..1 *(atemporal graphs; temporal histories may be represented via Embodiment records)*
| **Domain** | `agt:Agent`
| **Range** | `core:Thing`
| **Definition** | Links an Agent to the `core:Thing` that serves as its physical or digital substrate.
| **Usage Note** | Preserves the P2874 disjointness between `agt:Agent` and `core:Thing` (Thing DOMAIN: bounded items **without agency**; see §6.3.2.1.7). Use absence of this property to denote disembodied Agents (e.g., cloud services). For time-varying embodiment, model histories using time-bounded Embodiment records and derive the current substrate.
|===

[[agt-agent-property-embodiedBy]]
===== Property: embodiedBy
.Property Definition: agt:embodiedBy
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| **Property** | `agt:embodiedBy`
| **IRI** | identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/agent#embodiedBy]
| **JSON name** | `embodiedBy`
| **Requirement Level** | **Recommended** (when embodied)
| **Cardinality** | 0..1
| **Domain** | `core:Thing`
| **Range** | `agt:Agent`
| **Definition** | Inverse of `agt:embodiedIn`; links a `core:Thing` back to the Agent it embodies.
| **Usage Note** | This property allows implementers to navigate from the physical or digital substrate (`core:Thing`) to the agentive entity it supports. It complements `agt:embodiedIn` and maintains symmetry in embodiment modeling.
