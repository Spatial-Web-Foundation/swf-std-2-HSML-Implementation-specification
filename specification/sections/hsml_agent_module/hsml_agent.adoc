[[agt-agent]]
=== Class: agt:Agent

The class `agt:Agent` realises the **AGENT** concept in IEEE P2874 § 6.6.3:

“An ENTITY that senses, responds, and maintains a model of its environment while performing ACTIVITIES to achieve its goals.”

`agt:Agent` represents an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and enacting `act:Activity` instances in pursuit of its goals. It may represent a person, robot, AI system, or other autonomous entity.

**Key Requirements**

* **Identity**: Every `agt:Agent` **SHALL** possess a Spatial Web Identifier (`core:swid`, W3C DID Core-compliant).
* **Goal-Directed**: An `agt:Agent` **SHALL** be linked to one or more objectives it seeks to achieve via the `agt:hasGoal` property.
* **Capability**: An `agt:Agent` **SHALL** be linked to the `act:ActivitySchema` definitions for the activities it is capable of performing via the `agt:hasCapability` property.
