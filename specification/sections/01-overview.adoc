== Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Hyperspace Modeling Language (HSML) specification. It outlines the fundamental modeling paradigm, the design principles that guide its architecture, its modular structure, and the mechanisms for extending the language to meet specific domain needs.



=== The HSML Modeling Paradigm

HSML is built on a unique modeling paradigm designed to represent the complex, interconnected, and dynamic nature of the Spatial Web. This paradigm is founded on three key concepts: holons, semantics, and a graph-based structure.

* *Holons:* At the core of HSML is the concept of the "holon." A holon is an entity that is simultaneously a self-contained whole and a part of a larger system. Everything in the Spatial Web—from a user, a physical device, and a piece of data to an abstract concept like a legal contract or a permission—is represented as a holon. This holonic structure allows HSML to model nested, recursive, and compositional systems with a high degree of fidelity, reflecting the real-world "system of systems" reality.

* *Semantics:* HSML is a semantic modeling language. This means that every element and relationship within the model has a well-defined, machine-readable meaning. By leveraging semantic web technologies, HSML ensures that data is not just structured but also understood in context. This is crucial for enabling meaningful communication and interaction between diverse and autonomous systems, facilitating explainable AI, and ensuring that rules and governance can be applied consistently.

* *Graph Structure:* The Spatial Web is modeled as a vast, distributed semantic graph. In this graph, holons are the nodes (vertices), and the relationships between them are the edges. These edges are not simple pointers; they are semantically rich, defining the nature of the connection (e.g., `isLocatedAt`, `isOwnedBy`, `hasPermissionTo`). This graph-based approach allows for the representation of complex, multi-dimensional relationships and enables powerful querying and reasoning across the network.



=== Design Principles

The architecture of HSML is organized according to a set of core design principles that ensure it is robust, scalable, and adaptable for the global Spatial Web.

* *Composability:* Systems should be built from smaller, independent, and reusable components (holons). This principle allows for complex applications and environments to be assembled dynamically from a library of standardized parts.
* *Interoperability:* HSML provides a common semantic framework to ensure that systems, applications, and data from different developers and organizations can work together seamlessly and without ambiguity.
* *Leveraging Existing Standards:* To accelerate adoption and enhance interoperability, HSML avoids reinventing the wheel by integrating and aligning with established standards wherever possible, such as the Smart Applications REFerence ontology (SAREF), W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC), and the W3C Web of Things (WoT).
* *Extensibility:* The language is designed with extension in mind. It provides formal mechanisms to add new functionalities, data types, and domain-specific concepts without compromising the integrity of the core model or breaking backward compatibility.
* *Governance by Design:* Security, privacy, permissions, and regulatory policies are not add-ons but are woven into the fabric of the model itself. Every interaction can be subjected to rules that are an intrinsic part of the object's definition.




=== Core Model and Modules

To manage its complexity and facilitate implementation, the HSML specification is organized into a Core Model and a set of distinct modules.

* *Core Model:* The Core Model contains the most fundamental and universal constructs of HSML. It defines the abstract structure of a holon, its essential properties (like its unique identifier or `HSML_ID`), and the foundational types of relationships that can exist between holons. The Core Model is the universal foundation upon which all other parts of the language are built.

* *Modules:* Building on the Core Model, the specification is broken down into logical modules that extend the core set of concepts. Each module defines the schemas and rules for a specific functional domain. For example, there might be modules for:
** *Agents:* Defining users, organizations, and other autonomous or semi-autonomous actors.
** *Hyperspaces:* Defining the contextual spaces where interactions occur.
** *Channels:* Defining the pathways for communication and data exchange between agents.
** *Permissions & Governance:* Defining access rights, policies, and contracts.

This modular approach allows developers to implement only the parts of the specification relevant to their application while ensuring their implementation remains compatible with the broader ecosystem.



=== Extension Mechanisms

Recognizing that no single specification can anticipate all future needs, HSML includes formal mechanisms for extension. This allows the language to evolve and adapt to new technologies and industries.

* *Profiles:* A profile is a collection of specific HSML modules and constraints tailored for a particular application or industry. For example, a "Smart Mobility" profile might combine the Identity, Spatiotemporal, and a custom "Transportation" module to create a standard for autonomous vehicle networks. Profiles ensure interoperability within a specific vertical while still being based on the common HSML core.

* *Custom Schemas:* For more granular extensions, developers can define their own domain-specific schemas. This is achieved by leveraging the built-in extension mechanisms of standard semantic web technologies, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to define new types of holons, properties, and relationships, and the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) to define constraints and validation rules. These extensions can be registered and shared, allowing the entire Spatial Web ontology to grow organically while maintaining a coherent and logical structure.
