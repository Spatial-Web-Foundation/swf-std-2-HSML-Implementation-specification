== Abstract

The Hyperspace Modeling Language (HSML) Implementation Specification, a core compliance target of IEEE P2874â„¢ *Standard for Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture, and Governance*, defines a human- and machine-readable semantic modeling language and ontology for the Spatial Web. It establishes a shared vocabulary for **Entities, Domains, Agents, Activities, Credentials, Channels, Hyperspaces, and Governance**, providing a unifying framework for modeling structure, behavior, and trust.

HSML supports multiple spatial structures through the Hyperspace Module, including **topological, metric, vector, cellular, graph, and datatype spaces**. These are expressed using well-defined constructs such as points, paths, subspaces, tensor products, and functors, ensuring flexible yet precise representation of spatial and relational contexts.

The specification leverages **W3C Semantic Web standards (RDF 1.1/1.2, RDF-star, OWL 2, SHACL, JSON-LD 1.1)** to declare formal axioms, constraints, and validation shapes across heterogeneous implementations. It also introduces the **Hyperspace Semantic Query Language (HSQL)**, a query and validation language aligned with SPARQL 1.2 and extended for hyperspace constructs, enabling advanced reasoning over topological, metric, and vector relationships.

Every entity is identified by a **Spatial Web Identifier (SWID)** conformant with W3C DID Core, embedding DID-compliant documents and referenceable endpoints to provide decentralized identity, provenance, and discoverability.

HSML aligns with the **Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol (HSTP)** for message encapsulation and activity routing, and with the **Universal Domain Graph (UDG)** architecture for distributed discovery, linkage, and state management. Together, these enable interoperable, semantically consistent interactions among autonomous agents, digital twins, IoT devices, and distributed services.

As an Implementation Specification, HSML fulfills the compliance requirements of <<ieee-p2874,annex="A">>, providing the foundation for **cross-domain semantic interoperability, verifiable credential exchange, governed contract execution, explainable AI, and secure, zero-trust operations** within the global Spatial Web ecosystem.
