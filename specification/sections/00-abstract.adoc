== Abstract

The Hyperspace Modeling Language (HSML) Implementation Specification, a core compliance target of IEEE P2874™ "Standard for Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and Governance,” defines a human- and machine-readable semantic modeling language and ontology for the Spatial Web. It establishes a shared vocabulary for Domains, Entities, Agents, Activities, Credentials, Channels, and Hyperspaces, supporting multiple spatial structures—including topological, metric, cellular, and vector spaces—via well-defined hyperspace constructs such as points, paths, subspaces, tensor products, and functors.

HSML leverages W3C standards (RDF, OWL, SHACL) to express formal axioms and validation shapes, enforcing structure and constraints across heterogeneous implementations. It mandates the use of Spatial Web Identifiers (SWIDs) conformant with W3C DID Core for decentralized identity and discoverability, embedding SWID Documents and referenceable endpoints consistent with DID semantics.

By aligning with the Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol (HSTP) for message encapsulation and activity routing, and the Universal Domain Graph (UDG) architecture for distributed discovery and state management, HSML ensures interoperable, semantically compatible interactions among network-connected hardware and software systems.

As an Implementation Specification, HSML fulfills the compliance requirements listed in Annex A of P2874, enabling cross-domain semantic interoperability, verifiable credentials, governed contract execution, and secure, zero-trust operations within the global Spatial Web ecosystem .
