= HSML Modeling Language

The Spatial Web, as defined by the IEEE P2874 standard, envisions a globally interoperable, socio-technical fabric connecting humans, autonomous systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Its goal is to create a unified digital-physical reality where information is contextual, interactions are secure, and governance is an intrinsic part of the architecture. Realizing this vision requires a data model capable of representing complex, compositional systems with semantic precision and web-scale interoperability. This document analyzes the capabilities and limitations of the two dominant graph data paradigms—Labeled Property Graphs (LPGs) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF)—in meeting this challenge. We argue that while both offer valuable features, neither is sufficient in its standard form. The inherently holonic nature of Spatial Web `DOMAIN`s necessitates a conservative but fundamental extension to the RDF standard, introducing structural containment as a first-class primitive.

== The Core Challenge: Modeling Holonic `DOMAIN`s

The foundational concept of the Spatial Web is the `DOMAIN`. The IEEE P2874 standard defines a `DOMAIN` as a "sphere of knowledge, influence, or ACTIVITY." This is an intentionally broad definition, encompassing everything from physical spaces (a warehouse, a city), to conceptual systems (a supply chain, a legal framework), to active agents (a person, a robot).

A critical insight from the standard is that these `DOMAIN`s are inherently **holonic**. A holon is an entity that is simultaneously a whole in itself and a part of a larger whole. This compositional, nested structure is ubiquitous in the systems the Spatial Web aims to model:

* An *engine* (`DOMAIN`) is a whole composed of pistons and valves, but it is also a part of a *car* (`DOMAIN`).
* A *robotic arm* (`DOMAIN`) is a whole system, but it is also a part of an *assembly line* (`DOMAIN`), which is itself a part of a *factory* (`DOMAIN`).
* A *city* (`DOMAIN`) is a whole that contains buildings, parks, and infrastructure, but it is also a part of a *state* or *country* (`DOMAIN`).

This "wholes-within-wholes" structure is not merely descriptive; it is functional. It defines boundaries, scopes of authority, and contexts for interaction. Therefore, any data model intended to serve as the foundation for the Spatial Web's Universal Domain Graph (UDG) *must* be able to represent this nested, structural containment natively and with unambiguous, formal semantics.

== Analysis of Labeled Property Graphs (LPGs)

Labeled Property Graphs are the data model behind popular graph databases like Neo4j, JanusGraph, and Amazon Neptune. They consist of nodes, relationships, labels, and properties. Their intuitive structure and developer-friendly query languages have made them a dominant force in the graph database market.

=== LPG Strengths

LPGs possess several characteristics that are superficially attractive for modeling the Spatial Web:

* **Intuitive Modeling:** The node-relationship-property model is easy for developers to grasp. Modeling a part-whole relationship is as simple as creating two nodes and connecting them with a relationship labeled `:PART_OF`.
* **Traversal-Optimized Queries:** Query languages like Cypher are designed specifically for expressive, variable-length path traversals (e.g., `MATCH (part)-[:PART_OF*]->(whole)`), which is ideal for navigating hierarchical structures.
* **Performance:** LPG databases are often highly optimized for deep graph traversal and pattern matching performance within a single database instance.

=== LPG Limitations for the Spatial Web

Despite their strengths, LPGs have fundamental architectural limitations that make them unsuitable as the foundational standard for a global, interoperable Spatial Web.

==== Lack of Formal Semantics
The meaning of a node label or a relationship type in an LPG is defined by the application, not by the data model itself. The database understands that `(part)-[:PART_OF]->(whole)` is a directed edge, but it has no intrinsic understanding of what "part of" means. It does not know that this implies acyclicity or transitivity. This creates a **semantic gap**; the model is just a syntactic structure, and all meaning must be interpreted and enforced by application code. This is insufficient for the Spatial Web's goal of enabling autonomous agents and systems to interact based on a shared, machine-understandable understanding of the world.

==== Absence of Global Identifiers
Nodes and relationships in an LPG are identified by internal, database-specific IDs. There is no built-in concept of a global, web-resolvable identifier like a URI or IRI. This makes data federation—the act of linking and querying across multiple, independent graph databases—extraordinarily difficult. It requires complex, brittle, and proprietary middleware to reconcile identities. This directly contradicts the Spatial Web's vision of a **Universal Domain Graph (UDG)** that spans the entire web. The `swid` (Spatial Web Identifier), which is based on the W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) standard, requires a data model built on global identifiers.

==== Proprietary and Fragmented Ecosystem
While the GQL standard is an important step towards standardization, the LPG ecosystem remains fragmented. Different vendors implement different features, syntax variations, and performance characteristics. Building a global standard on a foundation that is not itself fully standardized and open is a precarious proposition. The Spatial Web requires a truly open, vendor-neutral foundation, analogous to the W3C standards that underpin the World Wide Web.

==== Containment as Convention, Not Primitive
In an LPG, containment is a **modeling convention**. The developer asserts that a relationship represents a part-whole connection. The database itself does not treat this relationship any differently from one labeled `:KNOWS` or `:LIKES`. It cannot natively enforce the logical constraints of containment (e.g., preventing a `DOMAIN` from containing itself) or provide specialized query operations based on this semantic. The burden of maintaining the integrity of the holonic structure falls entirely on the application layer.

== Analysis of the Resource Description Framework (RDF)

RDF is a W3C standard data model that forms the foundation of the Semantic Web. It represents information as a set of subject-predicate-object statements, or "triples."

=== RDF Strengths

RDF's design principles align very closely with the architectural requirements of the Spatial Web:

* **Formal, Model-Theoretic Semantics:** RDF has a rigorous, W3C-standardized semantics. The meaning of the data is defined by the model itself, enabling unambiguous interpretation and logical inference (entailment). This is precisely what is needed for machines to share and reason over data reliably.
* **Global Identifiers (IRIs):** The core components of an RDF triple (subject, predicate, and often the object) are identified by IRIs. This provides a native, built-in mechanism for global, web-scale identification and data federation, directly supporting the `swid` concept.
* **Standardized Open Ecosystem:** RDF is part of a mature suite of W3C standards, including SPARQL (query language), SHACL (validation language), and OWL (ontology language). This provides a rich, vendor-neutral toolkit for building sophisticated, interoperable systems.

=== RDF Limitations for Modeling Holonic `DOMAIN`s

Despite its strengths, the standard RDF model (including the RDF 1.2 revision with RDF-star) has a critical architectural deficiency: it is a **"flat graph."** It excels at describing relationships *between* resources but has no primitive concept for one resource being structurally *inside* another. This leads to significant challenges when trying to model the nested `DOMAIN`s of the Spatial Web.

==== The Failure of Standard Reification
The original solution for statement-level metadata, reification, is unsuitable for modeling containment. It is excessively verbose (requiring four triples to describe one), semantically weak (describing a statement does not assert it), and models the provenance of a statement *token*, not a structural boundary.

==== The Failure of Named Graphs
Using named graphs (quads) is the most common workaround for grouping triples, but it is fundamentally a dataset management feature, not a resource modeling primitive.

. **Dataset-Level Partitioning:** Named graphs partition the triple store. They do not model a containment relationship *between resources within a single graph*. A `DOMAIN` is a resource that should be ableto be a subject or object of other triples; a named graph's identifier is not typically used this way.
. **Ambiguous Semantics:** The meaning of a named graph is not formally defined. It could be a document, a context, or a dataset. This ambiguity is unacceptable for the precise modeling required by the Spatial Web.
. **Querying Paradigm Mismatch:** Querying with the `GRAPH` clause in SPARQL is a meta-level operation that changes the active graph for a sub-pattern. It is not a traversal of a part-whole relationship and does not compose with property paths, making hierarchical queries clumsy and unnatural.

==== The Limitations of RDF-star
RDF-star is a powerful and elegant solution for annotating *individual triples*. It allows one to make statements about other statements, such as `<< :engine-123 :partOf :car-789 >> :confidence 0.99`. It is perfect for attaching metadata to a single relationship. However, it *cannot* group a set of resources into a containing whole. It answers, "What can be said about this edge?" but it cannot answer, "What resources exist inside the boundary of this `DOMAIN`?"

== The Path Forward: A Holonic Extension to RDF

The analysis reveals a clear dichotomy:

* **LPGs** have an intuitive model for hierarchy but lack the formal semantics and global identifiers needed for a web-scale, interoperable system.
* **RDF** has the formal semantics and global identifiers but lacks a native model for hierarchy and structural containment.

The logical path forward is not to choose one over the other, but to synthesize their strengths. This requires a conservative but fundamental extension to the RDF standard to introduce the concept of containment as a first-class citizen.

This is the purpose of **RDF 2.0 with Holon Extensions**. It addresses the limitations of standard RDF by introducing two new constructs:

1.  **The `h:Holon` Primitive:** A formal declaration (`rdf:type h:Holon`) that a resource can act as a container. This directly maps to the Spatial Web `DOMAIN` concept, giving it a concrete, machine-understandable type.

2.  **The Primitive Containment Relation (`⊂`):** This is the core innovation. Containment is no longer just a predicate represented by an IRI; it is a fundamental part of the data model's structure, like a triple itself. It has built-in, processor-enforced semantics based on mereology: it is **transitive, irreflexive, and acyclic**.

This extension resolves the issues identified above:

* It provides a **semantically precise** and **unambiguous** way to model the "wholes-within-wholes" structure of Spatial Web `DOMAIN`s.
* It operates at the **resource level**, allowing holons to be seamlessly integrated into the rest of the RDF graph.
* It enables **native, intuitive traversal** of the holarchy using an extended SPARQL-H with property paths like `CONTAINS+`, mirroring the ease-of-use of LPG query languages.
* It builds upon the existing strengths of RDF, including global IRIs (`swid`), formal semantics, and the ability to use RDF-star to annotate containment edges (creating **Boundary Graphs** for governance).


The visionary architecture of the Spatial Web requires a data model that is simultaneously structurally expressive, semantically rigorous, and web-scalable. Labeled Property Graphs offer structural intuition but fail on semantic rigor and global interoperability. The standard Resource Description Framework offers semantic rigor and global interoperability but fails on structural expression of containment.

The necessary solution is to evolve the RDF standard to RDF 2.0. By introducing the `Holon` and a primitive containment relation, RDF 2.0 provides the crucial synthesis. It equips the proven, standardized, and semantically rich foundation of RDF with the native hierarchical modeling capabilities needed to build a truly interoperable, intelligent, and governable Spatial Web.
