[[hspace-path]]
=== Class: hspace:Path

The class +hspace:Path+ represents a **composed path**: a finite composition of arrows in a given Hyperspace.
It provides an identifiable resource on which systems can attach metadata, validate step coherence, and (optionally)
serialize a concrete realization (e.g., a LineString or JSON sequence), without altering the core arrow-based semantics.

==== Class Definition

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| RDF Class | +hspace:Path+
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A first-class representation of a composed path (finite sequence of arrows) within a Hyperspace.
| Subclass Of | hspace:Entity
| Usage Note | Use when a path requires identity, metadata, validation, or serialization; otherwise, implicit path composition via arrow mappings suffices.
| Rationale | Enables reproducible, governed, and interoperable exchange of paths (IDs, provenance, metrics) while keeping navigation arrow-driven.

[NOTE]
====
*Conformance.* A profile that names a class in +hspace:hasPathType+ MAY use +hspace:Path+ directly or a subclass thereof (e.g., +ex:Route+, +vector:LineString+), applying the properties above as appropriate to the element representation (resource-based or literal-based).
