== HSML CellularSpace Module

=== Introduction

The CellularSpace Module defines the HSML specialization of Hyperspace for **discrete partitioned structures**.
It realizes the *CELLULAR SPACE* concept of <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.2.1">>, which states:

[quote]
____
A space partitioned into finite, discrete units (cells) such that adjacency between units is explicitly defined
by shared boundaries, vertices, or faces. Cells may be uniform or hierarchical, and together they form
a covering of the domain.
____

This definition allows HSML to treat diverse gridded or tiled representations—raster images,
Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), and voxel volumes—under one unifying abstraction.

CellularSpaces make it possible to reason over **adjacency, clustering, and coverage** in contexts where
continuous metrics or coordinates are less important than **discrete neighborhood relationships**.

Crucially, CellularSpaces are **modular extensions** of Hyperspace:
they inherit the universal notions of elements, arrows, and paths, and specialize them for tessellations.
This means that a Domain can seamlessly switch between a VectorSpace view (coordinates),
a MetricSpace view (distances), or a CellularSpace view (discrete tilings) without losing identity or consistency.

=== Architectural Principles and Design Rationale

==== The Partitioned View of Space: cell:Cell

A CellularSpace is built upon the concept of the `cell:Cell`, a discrete unit that partitions a continuous region into finite, indivisible elements.
Unlike vector coordinates (continuous) or topological sets (abstract neighborhoods), a cell represents a **bounded piece of space** with an identifier, optional geometry, and adjacency relations.

This reflects IEEE P2874’s notion that spatial reasoning must sometimes operate at the **granularity of discrete tiles**—pixels, hexagons, voxels—rather than continuous measures.
Cells form the foundation for scalable computations such as tiling the Earth with DGGS codes, pathfinding in grid-based simulations, and aggregating spatial statistics.

==== Adjacency as the Fundamental Relation: cell:CellAdjacency

In a CellularSpace, connectivity is determined not by metric distance but by **adjacency rules**.
The `cell:CellAdjacency` class provides the scaffolding to model these rules explicitly:

* Von Neumann adjacency (sharing an edge, 4-neighbor).
* Moore adjacency (sharing edge or corner, 8-neighbor).
* Hexagonal adjacency (sharing sides in a hex grid).
* Voxel adjacencies (6-, 18-, or 26-neighbor in 3D).

Adjacency may be undirected (“touches”) or weighted (cost, travel time).
By modeling adjacency as a first-class construct, HSML enables **region formation, boundary detection, and pathfinding** independent of geometry.

==== Hierarchy and Indexing

A key design principle is **hierarchical decomposition**. CellularSpaces may be recursive: a DGGS cell contains children at finer resolutions, while raster tiles can be subdivided into pixels.
Each cell SHALL have a unique index, such as a DGGS code, Morton/Hilbert code, or `(row, col)` coordinate. This provides stable identity for referencing, linking, and computation.

==== Profiles and Extensibility

The CellularSpace Module defines a **minimal contract**: elements (cells) and arrows (adjacencies).
Domain-specific profiles can extend this for raster, DGGS, or voxel models. Examples:

* **Raster Profile**: Cells as `(row, col)` indices with 4- or 8-adjacency.
* **DGGS Profile**: Hierarchical hex cells identified by DGGS addresses.
* **Voxel Profile**: Integer `(x, y, z)` indices with 6-, 18-, or 26-neighbor rules.

This ensures HSML provides both **generic interoperability** and **domain-specific fidelity**.

==== Modularity and Namespaces

The CellularSpace vocabulary resides under its own namespace:

* `https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/hyperspace/cell#`

This aligns with the modular namespace strategy of HSML, ensuring clarity, extensibility, and best practices in ontology design.

=== Normative Classes

This clause provides the normative definitions for all class concepts within the CellularSpace Module.
The namespace prefix `cell:` refers to `https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/hyperspace/cell#`.
