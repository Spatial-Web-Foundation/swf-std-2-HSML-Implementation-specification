== HSML VectorSpace SubModule

=== Introduction

The VectorSpace Module specializes the Hyperspace abstraction for **linear spaces**.  
It realizes the *VECTOR SPACE* concept of IEEE P2874 (§ 6.2.x) as a Hyperspace whose elements admit **linear combination over a scalar field**, with an abstract **origin** and **composable arrows** corresponding to linear displacements.

____
“A vector space is a set whose elements can be added and scaled, satisfying linearity axioms.  
In HSML, a VectorSpace is a Hyperspace that also qualifies as a MetricSpace, exposing linear and distance semantics without prescribing a particular element encoding or path representation.”
____

This module is intentionally **non-prescriptive** about representation. It defines vector-space semantics and mapping hooks while allowing deployments to bind coordinates, arrays, or geometries according to their needs.  
Vector spaces are used across the Spatial Web for **geometric coordinates**, **embeddings and feature spaces**, **signal/field representations**, and **local linearizations** of complex manifolds.

By design, a `vector:VectorSpace`:

* Inherits all properties of `hspace:Hyperspace` (elements, arrows, paths, operations).  
* Inherits all properties of `metric:MetricSpace` (distance, polarity, axioms, metrics).  
* Adds linear structure hooks (scalar field, dimension, origin policy, CRS).
