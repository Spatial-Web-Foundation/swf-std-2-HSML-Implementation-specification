[[hsml-hyperspace]]
=== Class: hspace:Hyperspace

The class hspace:Hyperspace realises the HYPERSPACE concept in <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.6.3">> and Hyperspace Modeling principles:

[quote]
____
A HYPERSPACE is a spatial structure that specifies relationships among elements (points) in a DOMAIN, including notions such as adjacency, distance, connectivity, or metric, enabling spatial reasoning and operations within the Spatial Web.
____

hspace:Hyperspace provides the formal structure for expressing the spatial logic that governs how entities in a Domain relate to each other. It generalizes topology, metric spaces, graphs, cellular grids, vector spaces, and datatype spaces into a unified model, supporting composable and navigable relationships across Domains.

This specification separates:

* **Hyperspace-level properties** — what the space *is* and how navigation is driven (element type, arrow type, path type, optional edge predicate).
* **Element-class properties** — properties used *on the element instances* (when elements are resources).
* **Path-class properties** — properties used *on path instances* (explicit paths), including variants for literal-based elements.

.Class Definition for hspace:Hyperspace
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| RDF Class | `hspace:Hyperspace`
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | A spatial structure attached to a Domain that defines relationships among its elements, supporting spatial reasoning, navigation, and operations.
| Subclass Of | hspace:Entity
| Usage Note | Hyperspaces specify how elements in a Domain relate (e.g., adjacency, distance) and drive spatial queries, validation, and tooling.
| Rationale | Provides a formal, flexible mechanism to encode spatial structure (graph, cellular, vector, metric, datatype) that underpins Spatial Web reasoning.
