=== Class: metric:Polarity

<<metric-polarity,metric:Polarity>> captures the ordering semantics of measures produced by a <<metric-metric,metric:Metric>>. It tells engines whether lower values are better (<<metric-distance,metric:Distance>>) or higher values are better (<<metric-similarity,metric:Similarity>>). Polarity is attached to a metric via <<metric-metric-property-polarity,metric:polarity>> and is intentionally decoupled from both metric axioms (see <<metric-metrickind,metric:MetricKind>>) and the computation plan (see <<metric-metric-property-function,metric:function>>). This separation lets systems perform uniform ranking, thresholding, pruning, and planning across heterogeneous metrics without knowing the metric’s internal math.

Polarity also coordinates with optional scale hints and bounds declared on the metric (see <<metric-metric-property-scaleKind,metric:scaleKind>>, <<metric-metric-property-rangeMin,metric:rangeMin>>, <<metric-metric-property-rangeMax,metric:rangeMax>>) so UIs and algorithms can choose consistent comparators, normalize scores, and validate thresholds. When conversions are needed—such as consuming a similarity where a distance is expected or vice-versa—engines may apply the declared monotone transform (see <<metric-metric-property-monotoneTransform,metric:monotoneTransform>>) while preserving order.

Polarity is mandatory for metrics (enforced by SHACL), ensuring that operations like kNN, range queries, and top-k selection behave predictably. Note that <<metric-measure,metric:Measure>> remains polarity-neutral: the interpretation of a stored measurement is taken from its associated metric via <<metric-measure-property-usingMetric,metric:usingMetric>>.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| RDF Class | metric:Polarity
| Is Abstract | No
| Definition | Vocabulary class whose instances tag whether a measure behaves as a distance (lower-is-better) or a similarity (higher-is-better).
| Subclass Of | owl:Thing
| Usage Note | Used as the range of <<metric-metric-property-polarity,metric:polarity>> on <<metric-metric,metric:Metric>> to declare the intended ordering of values and to guide ranking, thresholding, and conversion via <<metric-metric-property-monotoneTransform,metric:monotoneTransform>>.
| Rationale | Separates numeric ordering semantics from metric axioms (see <<metric-metrickind,metric:MetricKind>>) and from the computation plan (see <<metric-metric-property-function,metric:function>>), enabling uniform treatment of distances and similarities.

| Individual | Description

| <<metric-distance,metric:Distance>>
| Polarity tag indicating distance semantics: lower values indicate greater closeness; typical domains are ratio-scaled and non-negative. Often paired with aggregators such as <<metric-aggregator,metric:Aggregator>> = <<metric-sum,metric:Sum>>.

| <<metric-similarity,metric:Similarity>>
| Polarity tag indicating similarity semantics: higher values indicate greater likeness; often normalized to <<metric-scalekind,metric:UnitInterval>> with optional bounds supplied via <<metric-metric-property-rangeMin,metric:rangeMin>> / <<metric-metric-property-rangeMax,metric:rangeMax>>.
