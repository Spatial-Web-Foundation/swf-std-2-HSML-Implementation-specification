== HSML TopologicalSpace SubModule

=== Introduction

The TopologicalSpace Module specializes the Hyperspace abstraction for structures defined by **neighborhoods, adjacency, and continuity**, rather than numeric coordinates.
It realizes the *TOPOLOGICAL SPACE* concept referenced in <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.2.1">> and HSML Hyperspace design:

____
A topological space is a set of elements together with a structure that specifies which subsets are ‘open,’
thereby defining notions of adjacency, neighborhood, and continuity without reference to metric distance.

In HSML, a TopologicalSpace provides a declarative way to represent **connectivity, adjacency, boundaries, and regions**.
It is the natural home for **geometries beyond points**, including *LineStrings*, *Polygons*, and *Spheres*, which are not valid vector elements but can be modeled in a topological sense.

Typical use cases include:

* Geographic features — regions, boundaries, polygonal areas, networks of connected edges.
* Computational grids — adjacency of cells in raster or tessellated models.
* Continuity spaces — abstract topologies for states, neighborhoods, or coverage.

A TopologicalSpace inherits from `hspace:Hyperspace` and introduces adjacency and region semantics.
It does not assume distances (`metric:Metric`) unless combined with a MetricSpace; instead, it captures **purely topological relations**.

=== Architecture and Design Rationale

==== Core Principle
TopologicalSpaces in HSML are **relation-first**: they define what is “next to” or “contained in what,” rather than how far apart elements are.
This makes them suitable for **qualitative spatial reasoning** and **boundary-driven models**.

==== Subclassing Strategy
* `topo:TopologicalSpace` is a subclass of `hspace:Hyperspace`.
* Optional specializations include:
  - `topo:TopologicalMetricSpace` — adds metric distance on top of adjacency.
  - `topo:CellularSpace` — specialization for discrete grids and tessellations.

==== Elements and Paths
* **Element Type** — any spatial unit such as `geo:Polygon`, `geo:LineString`, or `cell:Cell`.
* **Path Type** — adjacency relations such as `topo:adjacentTo` or `topo:connectedTo`.
* Elements may represent continuous regions (polygons, spheres) or discrete cells.
* Paths represent adjacency chains (sequences of touching elements, border walks).

==== Neighborhoods and Open Sets
Unlike VectorSpaces, which define neighborhoods via coordinates and metrics, TopologicalSpaces rely on **declared adjacency** or **open sets**:

* `topo:hasNeighborhood` links an element to its set of neighboring elements.
* SHACL profiles may constrain neighborhood semantics (e.g., Moore vs. Von Neumann adjacency in a grid).

==== Regions and Boundaries
TopologicalSpaces support grouping and edge semantics:

* `topo:Region` — a contiguous set of adjacent elements treated as one area.
* `topo:Boundary` — the separating edge or border between a region and its exterior.

These abstractions allow modeling polygon boundaries, country borders, adjacency of cellular clusters, and more.

==== Generic Operations
TopologicalSpaces extend the universal Hyperspace algebra with **qualitative operations**:

* **Neighborhood query** — return adjacent elements of a given element.
* **Adjacency test** — check if two elements share a border or node.
* **Connectivity test** — check if two elements belong to the same connected component.
* **Path composition** — concatenate adjacency steps into longer paths.
* **Reachability** — determine if a path exists between two elements.
* **Boundary extraction** — identify the separating elements between regions.
* **Region closure / interior** — derive closed vs. open sets.
* **Union / intersection of regions** — form composite regions.
* **Subspace formation** — restrict to a subset of elements with induced adjacency.
* **Quotienting by equivalence** — merge elements under an equivalence relation (e.g., administrative aggregation).

These operations are **generic** and apply across polygonal, line-based, cellular, and spherical topologies.

==== Separation of Concerns
* **Domain vs Hyperspace** — a Domain provides identity; attaching a TopologicalSpace defines adjacency and region semantics.
* **Topology vs Metric** — adjacency is qualitative; distances are layered on top when required.
* **Profiles** — SHACL profiles constrain adjacency semantics (e.g., polygons must be closed, cells must tessellate consistently).

==== Examples of Spaces

TopologicalSpaces are not limited to geometry — they capture **adjacency and connectivity** in many domains:

*Geometric Topologies*
- **Polygonal Topology**: elements are polygons; adjacency = “share an edge.”
- **Line Network**: elements are line segments; adjacency = “share a node.”
- **Spherical Topology**: elements are regions on a sphere; adjacency defined by great-circle boundaries.
- **Cellular/DGGS Topology**: elements are discrete cells; adjacency defined by tessellation rules.

*Computational / Data Structures*
- **Graph Topology**: elements are graph nodes; adjacency defined by edges.
- **Tree Topology**: elements are tree nodes; adjacency = parent–child relations.
- **Cellular Automaton Topology**: elements are cells; adjacency defined by automaton rules (Moore, Von Neumann).

*Abstract / Conceptual Topologies*
- **State Space Topology**: elements are states in a machine; adjacency defined by transitions.
- **Semantic Neighborhood Topology**: elements are SKOS concepts; adjacency via broader/narrower/related links.
- **Linguistic Topology**: elements are words; adjacency via co-occurrence in a context window.
- **Process Topology**: elements are workflow activities; adjacency via “precedes” or “depends on” relations.

*Scientific / Physical Topologies*
- **Biological Cell Topology**: elements are cells in tissue; adjacency via direct contact.
- **Protein Folding Topology**: elements are amino acids; adjacency via sequential bonds + folding contacts.
- **Neural Network Topology**: elements are neurons; adjacency via synaptic connections.



To summarize, the TopologicalSpace Module captures **adjacency and neighborhood semantics** without relying on coordinates or metrics.
It provides the structural foundation for representing **Polygons, LineStrings, Spheres, and beyond** as elements, enabling **qualitative reasoning, boundary logic, and region-based navigation** in HSML.
