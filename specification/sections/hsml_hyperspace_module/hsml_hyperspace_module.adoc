== HSML Hyperspace Module

=== Introduction


The Hyperspace Module defines the structural foundation for representing spatial relationships in HSML.  
It realizes the **HYPERSPACE** concept of IEEE P2874 (§ 6.2.1), which defines a hyperspace as:

“A set whose elements are related by a formal notion of path, satisfying identity and composition laws.  
Paths may be abstract, as long as they can be ‘traversed’ in a fashion akin to the paths between points 
in familiar spaces.” 

The purpose of this generalization is to capture not only Euclidean and geographic spaces, but also 
more abstract domains where entities are organized by structural relationships. A hyperspace therefore 
provides a **uniform abstraction** for expressing adjacency, connectivity, distance, ordering, or 
other relationships that allow elements of a Domain to be navigated.

In the context of the Spatial Web, this abstraction is critical. Domains contain entities, but it is 
their **relationships within a hyperspace** that enable reasoning, coordination, and navigation.  
For example:  

* In **Agent, Person, and Organization Domains**, hyperspaces describe social and organizational networks.  
* In **Geographic Domains**, hyperspaces describe spatial structure through geometries, grids, and metrics.  
* In **Concept Domains**, hyperspaces describe semantic or datatype structures (taxonomies, codes, numbers, strings, colors, tensors).  
* In **Thing Domains**, hyperspaces describe assemblies, dependencies, or placements.  

Without hyperspaces, Domains would be mere collections of entities. With hyperspaces, they become 
**structured spaces** that can be queried, validated, and traversed. This makes the Hyperspace Module 
an essential component of HSML and of the Spatial Web as a whole.

=== Architectural Principles and Design Rationale

The Hyperspace Module defines the structural foundation for representing spatial relationships in HSML.  
It provides a universal abstraction that applies across multiple domains, while committing only to the 
minimum semantics required for interoperability. This design ensures that the model remains lightweight, 
flexible, and extensible, as required by IEEE P2874.

==== Minimum Ontological Commitment

The first principle is **minimum ontological commitment**. The core Hyperspace does not attempt to prescribe 
a single way of representing space. Instead, it declares only the most universal concepts:

* **Elements** — the points or objects of the space.  
* **Arrows** — the atomic, one-step relations between elements.  
* **Paths** — finite compositions of arrows that support identity and concatenation.  
* **Core Properties** — a small set of universally valid relations (`hyperspace:stepTo`, 
  `hyperspace:neighborOf`, `hyperspace:reachable`, `hyperspace:onPath`).  

This restraint allows domains to adopt HSML without being forced into a single representation of space.  
Geometries may be encoded as literals, cells may be represented by indices, and graphs may be modeled 
with object properties or reified edges. All of these are equally valid within the core abstraction.

==== Separation of Domain and Hyperspace

A **Domain** defines the context in which entities exist. A **Hyperspace** attached to that Domain specifies 
how those entities are spatially related. This separation of concerns allows:

* A Domain to be reinterpreted under different spatial logics (e.g., a road network can be modeled as a 
  graph space or as a metric space).  
* Multiple Hyperspaces to coexist, enabling federation across heterogeneous systems.  
* Governance and identity to be scoped cleanly, since each Hyperspace is addressable in its own right.  

==== Arrows and Paths

The Hyperspace distinguishes between **arrows** (atomic steps) and **paths** (compositions of steps).  
This distinction generalizes across many spatial models:

* In a graph, arrows are edges and paths are walks.  
* In a grid, arrows are adjacencies and paths are chains of cells.  
* In a vector space, arrows are line segments and paths are polylines.  
* In a state machine, arrows are transitions and paths are traces of execution.  

By modeling arrows and paths separately, the core supports both fine-grained reasoning and higher-level 
encodings (such as a `LINESTRING` geometry). This categorical foundation guarantees closure under 
composition and predictable semantics for navigation.

==== Lightweight and Rich Edge Modeling

Edges can be modeled in two complementary ways:

* **Lightweight property edges** — direct object properties asserting adjacency (e.g., `:a connectsTo :b`).  
* **Reified edges** — explicit resources (`hyperspace:Arrow`) with `hyperspace:source` and `hyperspace:target`, 
  capable of carrying attributes such as weight, cost, or provenance.  

The Hyperspace Module does not mandate one approach. Instead, it provides bridging properties so that 
implementations can interoperate across both representations.

==== Operations as Declared Capabilities

A Hyperspace is not only a structure; it is also the set of **operations** that may be applied to that structure.  
The module treats operations as explicit, discoverable entities. Each Hyperspace may declare supported 
operations via `hyperspace:hasOperation`, referencing instances of `hyperspace:Operation` with defined 
identifiers, input constraints, and output types.  

This explicit declaration ensures that capabilities such as reachability, shortest path, clustering, or 
buffering are machine-readable and testable, rather than assumed.

==== Specialized Hyperspaces (Overview)

The core Hyperspace remains abstract and minimal. When additional semantics are required, they are introduced 
through **specialized modules** under dedicated namespaces. Examples include:

* **GraphSpace** (`hyperspace/graph`) — emphasizes connectivity (nodes, edges, routes).  
* **CellularSpace** (`hyperspace/cell`) — emphasizes adjacency in grids and tessellations (cells, neighborhoods).  
* **VectorSpace** (`hyperspace/vector`) — emphasizes coordinates and geometry encodings (CRS, geometries).  
* **MetricSpace** (`hyperspace/metric`) — emphasizes distance and similarity functions (metrics, clustering).  

Other extensions are possible, such as higher-order Hyperspaces (Hyperspaces of Hyperspaces), 
spatio-temporal Hyperspaces, or state-machine Hyperspaces.  

Detailed normative definitions for each specialization are provided in their respective module specifications.  
The core module only requires that specialized properties align back to universal ones, such as 
`hyperspace:stepTo`, `hyperspace:neighborOf`, and `hyperspace:reachable`.

==== Handling of Time

Time is an essential dimension in many real-world spaces, but not all Hyperspaces require it.  
To preserve minimality, time is not built into the core. Instead, it is introduced via annotations and 
extensions, using established vocabularies such as OWL-Time. Arrows and paths may carry properties 
such as `time:validDuring`, `time:hasDuration`, or `time:hasBeginning`/`time:hasEnd`.  

This approach allows temporal reasoning where needed — for example, time-dependent road networks, 
trajectories, or evolving grids — without burdening every Hyperspace.

==== Identity and Governance

Every Hyperspace is identified by a **Spatial Web Identifier (SWID)**, which conforms to W3C DID Core.  
This ensures that Hyperspaces are resolvable, governable, and referenceable across domains.  
While the Hyperspace Module itself does not embed governance logic, the SWID provides the anchor for 
policies, credentials, and trust frameworks defined elsewhere in HSML.

==== Validation Through Profiles

Validation is expressed through **SHACL profiles**, not rigid OWL cardinalities.  
This allows the ontology to stay flexible, while profiles can enforce strict constraints in specific contexts.  
For example, a profile may require that a Hyperspace use `geo:Geometry` as its element type, or that 
a particular adjacency property be used for its arrows.  

This design enables lightweight interoperability at the core and precise validation in domain-specific deployments.


In summary, the Hyperspace Module commits only to what is universal: elements, arrows, paths, and a handful of 
generic properties. All other semantics are layered in specialized modules or enforced through profiles.  
This ensures that HSML provides a single unifying abstraction for spatial reasoning while remaining 
modular, extensible, and adaptable to the diverse structures of the Spatial Web.
