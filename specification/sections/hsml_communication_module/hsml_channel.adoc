[[comm-channel]]
=== Class: `comm:Channel`

The `comm:Channel` class realizes the *CHANNEL* concept as defined in the IEEE P2e874 draft standard. As a central element of the communications (+comm+) module, it provides a contextual container that links participants, data, and messages around specific Activities without forming part of the permanent domain hierarchy. This enables ad-hoc, session-based, or otherwise transient coordination and monitoring.

This class is a subclass of `hsml:Entity`, inheriting a `hsml:swid` as its unique identifier.


==== Key Requirements & Design Principles

* A `comm:Channel` *shall link* to at least one `hsml:Activity` it supports.
* A `comm:Channel` *shall be disjoint* from `hsml:Domain`, as it represents a non-hierarchical, transient grouping.
* A `comm:Channel` *shall include* one or more participants via the `core:hasParticipant` property.
* Parent-child relationships between channels *shall be modeled* using the inverse properties `comm:hasSubChannel` and `comm:subChannelOf`.
* Governance and access control *are intentionally delegated* to the Governance Module and are not embedded properties of a Channel.

==== Class Definition

.Class Definition for `comm:Channel`
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *RDF Class* | `comm:Channel`
| *Is Abstract* | No
| *Definition* | A contextual, non-hierarchical grouping of entities associated with a specific Activity or purpose, for coordinating transient communications.
| *Subclass Of* | `hsml:Entity`
| *Usage Note* | Channels are for transient, ad-hoc collaboration; they do not define domain boundaries or permanent hierarchies. The `core` namespace refers to a separate module defining foundational, cross-cutting properties.
| *Rationale* | Provides a lightweight mechanism for coordinating information and participants. Access control is delegated to the Governance Module; Channels do not embed their own access control lists (ACLs).

| *Property* | `core:hasParticipant`
| *IRI* | identifier:[https://schema.spatialwebfoundation.org/core#hasParticipant]
| *JSON Name* | `hasParticipant`
| *Requirement Level* | Mandatory
| *Cardinality* | 1..n
| *Domain* | `comm:Channel`
| *Range* | `hsml:Entity`
| *Definition* | Links the Channel to its participants (Agents, Things, or other Entities).
| *Usage Note* | A Channel must have at least one participant to be meaningful.

[[property-channel-forActivity]]
===== Property: `comm:forActivity`

.Property Definition: `comm:forActivity`
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| *Property* | `comm:forActivity`
| *IRI* | identifier:[https://schema.spatialwebfoundation.org/comm#forActivity]
| *JSON Name* | `forActivity`
| *Requirement Level* | Mandatory
| *Cardinality* | 1..n
| *Range* | `hsml:Activity`
| *Definition* | Associates the Channel with one or more Activities it supports or relates to.
| *Usage Note* | Channels provide the necessary communication and data context for their referenced Activities.

[[property-channel-hasSubChannel]]
===== Property: `comm:hasSubChannel`

.Property Definition: `comm:hasSubChannel`
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| *Property* | `comm:hasSubChannel`
| *IRI* | identifier:[https://schema.spatialwebfoundation.org/comm#hasSubChannel]
| *JSON Name* | `hasSubChannel`
| *Requirement Level* | Optional
| *Cardinality* | 0..n
| *Range* | `comm:Channel`
| *Inverse Property* | `comm:subChannelOf`
| *Definition* | Links the Channel to its sub-channels for hierarchical structuring of information streams.
| *Usage Note* | This property enables efficient downward traversal of the Channel hierarchy (from parent to children).
|===

[[property-channel-subChannelOf]]
===== Property: `subChannelOf`

.Property Definition: `comm:subChannelOf`
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| *Property* | `comm:subChannelOf`
| *IRI* | identifier:[https://schema.spatialwebfoundation.org/comm#subChannelOf]
| *JSON Name* | `subChannelOf`
| *Requirement Level* | Optional
| *Cardinality* | 0..1
| *Range* | `comm:Channel`
| *Inverse Property* | `comm:hasSubChannel`
| *Definition* | Links a sub-channel to its parent Channel.
| *Usage Note* | This property allows for efficient upward traversal of the Channel hierarchy. The `0..1` cardinality enforces a strict tree structure, preventing a single channel from having multiple parents.
